# Creating a React Component from a UI/Functional Spec

**Description:** Guide on using an LLM to generate a React component based on a UI description or Functional Specification snippet, emphasizing styling with Tailwind CSS.

**Key Points:**  
  * Translating visual descriptions and functional requirements from the spec into prompt requirements (component name, props, state, behavior, styling).  
  * Specifying desired libraries (React) and styling framework (Tailwind CSS) explicitly.  
  * Prompting for component structure, handling state/props as defined in the spec.  
  * Refining generated JSX and applying/correcting Tailwind classes based on the spec's visual requirements.  
  * Integrating the component into a sample React application and verifying its appearance and basic functionality.

**Assets:**  
  * Example UI/Functional Specification snippet (could include text descriptions, simple wireframe ASCII art, or reference to a diagram).  
  * **Prompt Template:** "Generate React Component from Spec" (Reusable Markdown template).  
  * Example LLM interaction flow.  
  * Code Snippets: Generated React component code (JSX with Tailwind classes).  
  * *Callout (Inline Tip):* "Tip: For complex UI, break it down into smaller components and generate them individually."  
  * *Callout (Inline Warning):* "Warning: LLMs might not perfectly replicate complex layouts from text descriptions alone. Visual review is essential."
