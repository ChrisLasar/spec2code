# Building a Simple REST API Endpoint from an Interface Spec

**Description:** Guide on using an LLM (e.g., via Copilot or Cursor) to generate code for a basic CRUD API endpoint based on a simplified Interface/API Specification snippet. Focuses on Python (Flask/FastAPI) or TypeScript (Node.js/Express).

**Key Points:**  
  * Understanding business requirements specifications
  * Breaking down requirements into actionable tasks
  * Using LLMs to generate initial code drafts
  * Analyzing the Interface/API Specification to identify key elements (endpoints, methods, request/response formats).  
  * Mapping requirements to code components
  * Crafting the initial prompt to request the API endpoint code, providing necessary context (language, framework, spec details).  
  * Iterative prompting to add details like input validation, basic error handling, and database interaction placeholders.  
  * Integrating the generated code into a minimal project structure.  
  * Basic manual testing or using a simple script to verify the endpoint's response structure.

**Assets:**  
  * Example Interface/API Specification snippet (Markdown or simple text format).  
  * **Prompt Template:** "Generate API Endpoint from Spec" (Reusable Markdown template).  
  * Example LLM interaction flow (showing initial prompt, refinement prompts, and responses).  
  * Code Snippets: Generated endpoint code, minimal application setup code.  
  * *Callout (Inline Tip):* "Common Pitfall: Over-reliance on the first LLM output. Always expect to iterate and refine based on the spec."  
  * *Callout (Inline Note):* "Tip: Be explicit about the desired libraries and framework versions in your prompt."
