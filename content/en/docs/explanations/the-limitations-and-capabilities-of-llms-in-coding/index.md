# The Limitations and Capabilities of LLMs in Coding

**Description:** A realistic and balanced look at what LLMs are currently good at in the context of software development and where their inherent limitations require human intervention and expertise. Addresses common misconceptions.

**Key Points:**  
  * **Capabilities:** Generating boilerplate code, writing simple functions, translating code between languages, suggesting syntax, refactoring small code blocks, writing initial drafts of tests, explaining code snippets.  
  * **Limitations:** Difficulty with complex algorithms, making architectural decisions, understanding the nuances of large, unfamiliar codebases, guaranteeing functional correctness or security, creative problem-solving beyond training patterns, handling ambiguous or incomplete specifications effectively without human clarification.  
  * The problem of "hallucination" â€“ generating plausible-looking but incorrect or non-existent code/APIs.  
  * The critical and irreplaceable need for human oversight, review, and domain expertise.  
  * *Callout (Inline Misconception):* "Common Misconception: LLMs can replace architects or senior engineers. They are tools that augment, not replace, human expertise."
