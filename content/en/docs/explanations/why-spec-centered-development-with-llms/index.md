**Key Points:**  

* Specifications as the stable, human-readable source of truth that transcends specific code implementations.  
* How a clear spec reduces ambiguity and potential LLM "hallucinations" or misinterpretations *before* code is generated.  
* Improving alignment and communication between different roles (Product, Design, QA, Engineering) by centering discussions on the spec.  
* LLMs as a powerful translation layer between structured human language (specifications) and code.  
* How this approach supports better maintainability and reduces technical debt compared to generating code without a clear, verifiable source.
* Separation of concerns
* Managing human+AI collaboration
* Reducing technical debt early
