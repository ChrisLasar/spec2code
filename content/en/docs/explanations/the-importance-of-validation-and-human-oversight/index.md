# The Importance of Validation and Human Oversight

**Description:** Reinforcing the critical role of human review, automated checks, and testing in the LLM-assisted workflow. Explains *why* generated code cannot be blindly trusted and the potential consequences of skipping validation steps.

**Key Points:**  
  * Why LLM output is a starting point, not a finished product.  
  * The risks of unchecked generated code: bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, technical debt, non-compliance with standards.  
  * The human role in verifying alignment with the specification, overall system design, performance requirements, and security policies.  
  * The necessity of comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) regardless of how the code was generated.  
  * Ethical considerations related to using LLMs for code (bias in training data, security implications).
