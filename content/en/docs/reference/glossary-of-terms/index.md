# Glossary of Terms

**Description:** Definitions of key terms used throughout the guide and commonly found in the LLM/AI coding space.

**Key Points:**  
  * Definitions for: LLM, Prompt Engineering, Specification (and brief definition of each type covered), Hallucination, Fine-tuning, Token, Context Window, Temperature (LLM parameter), Few-shot/Zero-shot prompting.  
  * Definition of llm.txt and llmd.txt: (Proposing standard usage)  
    * llm.txt: A project-level file (in the root directory) containing guidelines, constraints, and context for LLMs assisting with the project (e.g., preferred libraries, architectural patterns to follow/avoid, general coding standards).  
    * llmd.txt: Directory-specific files containing context, examples, or specific instructions relevant only to the code within that directory (e.g., details about a specific module, examples of patterns used in that area).
