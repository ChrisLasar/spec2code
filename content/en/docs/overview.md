* **Key Points:**  
  * The primacy of the specification as the single source of truth.  
  * LLMs as powerful accelerators for code generation and translation, not replacements for human design or verification.  
  * Balancing the speed of AI generation with the necessity of correctness, maintainability, and alignment with architectural goals.  
  * Brief overview of the guide's structure based on the Di√°taxis framework (Tutorials, How-to Guides, Reference, Explanations).
