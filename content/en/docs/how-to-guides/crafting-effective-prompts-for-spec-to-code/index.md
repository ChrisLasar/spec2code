# Crafting Effective Prompts for Spec-to-Code

**Description:** Advanced techniques and best practices for writing prompts that maximize the chances of getting accurate, relevant, and usable code from specifications. This is core "prompt engineering" for this specific use case.

**Key Points:**  
  * Structuring your prompts logically: Role/Persona, Context (project, libraries, relevant code), Instruction (the task), Examples (few-shot prompting), Format (desired output structure).  
  * Providing sufficient and relevant context without overwhelming the model.  
  * Translating abstract spec requirements into concrete coding tasks and constraints.  
  * Using negative constraints effectively ("Do not use library X", "Avoid pattern Y").  
  * Techniques for iterative prompting and refining output through conversation.  
  * Handling ambiguity in specifications through clarifying prompts.  
  * Decomposing specs into promptable units
  * Using "show, don't tell" in prompts
  * Prompt chaining for large features

  * Examples: Side-by-side comparison of ineffective vs. effective prompts for a given spec snippet.  
  * *Callout (Inline Tip):* "Tip: Start with a clear, concise instruction and add context/constraints iteratively if the initial output is insufficient."  
  * *Callout (Inline Misconception):* "Common Misconception: More detail is always better. Focus on *relevant* detail and clear structure."
