{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-rocket" title="Transform Specs into Code, Faster" %}}
Discover practical techniques to go from specifications – whether functional requirements, API designs, or user stories – to generated code drafts using LLM coding assistance. Learn to apply a workflow where the specification remains the primary source of truth, enhanced by AI acceleration.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-users" title="Who This Guide is For" %}}
Designed for senior software engineers, software architects, product owners, and product managers who have intermediate familiarity with AI tools and some ad-hoc experience with coding assistants. We bridge the gap between understanding the potential of LLMs and applying them effectively in development workflows.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fas fa-seedling" title="Our Core Philosophy" %}}
At the heart of this guide is the principle of specification-centered development. We show you how to use LLMs as powerful accelerators for code generation and translation, but always grounded in and verified against a clear, robust specification. Code is secondary; the spec is primary.
